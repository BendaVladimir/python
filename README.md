# python
 
This repository will contain learning materials and useful scripts for python. Main goal is to create notes on thing that I have learned and have it accessible on multiple computers.

Materials will be published in Jupyter notebooks because this is the simpleâ€™s way to combine code and comments. Adding of new materials in repository will be incremental and various parts of python ecosystem will be covered in the future.
